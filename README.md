# Abstract
This study employs Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to optimize gross profit for a local coffee shop, addressing challenges in inventory management and sale revenue optimization. A dataset comprising of 40 menu items and 34 ingredients was developed, incorporating constraints such as capital budget, ingredient availability, costs, and sales ratios to simulate monthly revenue. By applying the ILP methodology, the study achieved a gross profit margin of 42.28% of total sales revenue within a single month, underscoring its efficacy in improving profitability. The sensitivity analysis indicated that an increase in budget resulted in a proportional rise in sales revenue and gross profit, while inventory costs escalated at a comparatively slower pace. The research pinpointed high-performing items, including coffee, tea, and cold beverages, as significant contributors to profit, thereby highlighting the necessity for effective inventory management. 
# Dataset
The dataset used in this study representing the monthly operations of a local coffee shop in Iran. It includes 34 unique ingredients and 40 commonly offered products, such as coffees, teas, cakes, milkshakes, and smoothies. The dataset provides comprehensive details like ingredient quantities, costs (both rounded and exact), selling prices, seasonal trends, and product-level sales distributions.

# Results
Table (1) illustrates the key financial metrics predicted by the ILP model, including sale revenue, inventory costs, and gross profit. The model estimates a gross profit of $2673.8, representing 57.63% of the sale revenue income, a realistic and sustainable profit margin for a coffee shop of this scale and operational complexity.
